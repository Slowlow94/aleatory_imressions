This project was commissioned by La Nombreuse asbl (based in Saint-Gilles) for Alan Jeuland's exhibition at the Photo Brussels Festival 2024.
The principle behind this little program is to use a graphic interface - in this case a computer - to launch a print without going through the printer's settings control window, and without printing the same two files one after the other.
